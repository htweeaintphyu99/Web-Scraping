# Web-Scraping
This is the project made by a startup company and a team of two people worked on this project. Data collection from social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn is done using Selenium. User can modify desired links to replace ones in the sources code to extract data from. Collected data such as post descriptions, comments and many more are saved as a csv file.
